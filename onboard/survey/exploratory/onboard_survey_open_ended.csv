It felt very easy to use, secure, and transactions were paid for at the time. Looked like another banking app so it was very reassuring, plus no need to use seed phrase. ","The main pain point that I got using wallets was not being really able to manage gas prices myself, or having delays between sending my transaction and seeing it really submitted (Ledger in particular).

","Wallet compatibility is always an obstacle. Not being able to use Alchemix with my usual wallets was painful. But that's not only concerning Defi, for example claiming the BANK turned out to be impossible with Argent, same with obtaining the Discord access. Other than that, my lack of technical expertise (like reading code) always makes me anxious about using a protocol, not enough to push me to start learning about it, but enough to make me wait and miss opportunities. ","The Uniswap airdrop was really a big surprise, and at the same time it made me realize this space really had a different perspective on ownership, and real values. DeFi has shown me the power and ethos of Ethereum.","Alchemix is really the app that's making me tick these days, the alETH, the v2, how it gives the power to spend 50% of a certain amount of money without sacrificing too much, gives my risk adverse side more willingness to go a little crazy.
